                <p>Defensive power was almost inexistent at the time of arrival of the 
                    Knights. The Order saw defence and protection of utmost 
                    importance due to other powers becoming interested in Malta. Firstly, they saw to the protection of the 
                    harbours by building numerous forts and fortifying
                    Fort St Angelo. Later, it came to their knowledge the need 
                    of fortifying the naked coastline from which pirates could easily
                    enter and embark. In the 17th century
                    the Grandmasters Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin self-financed
                        the building of several coastal watchtowers.</p>
